#Hi! I’m Aditya Sah, an intermediate programmer from India. I have experience in Java, Python, C++, Bash, and JavaScript, and I enjoy developing web applications with HTML and CSS.
I’m passionate about problem-solving and turning complex requirements into functional code. When I’m not coding, I participate in hackathons, contribute to open-source projects, and practice martial arts.
I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and am always eager to learn new technologies. My goal is to create software that meets user needs and provides a seamless experience. Feel free to reach out 
for collaboration or a chat about programming!
